subtitle: Who is she?
---

This website is dedicated to expressing how amazing Sonam is. She does not receive nearly as much recognition and praise for her vibrant and powerful character. Sonam is truly a one-of-a-kind partner and I have made a grave mistake in undervaluing her presence in my life. My intention with this website is to express completely all the emotions I feel for this girl - I have severely lacked vocal communication throughout our relationship. I want to make things right and I understand that words are not enough compared to action and although I cannot be there with her physically, I want to show her what she means to me. I will do my best to incorporate everything I feel into this website through blog posts about her character to this section here about her history.  

### Early Life
Sonam was born and raised in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. I do not know much about her life from back then because she moved to Arizona early in her life, but one thing I do know is that she is a die-hard passionate Patriots fan. One time, I undermined her committment to the team in which she was vividly upset with me. I have only encountered a similar minded sports fan before earlier that year (my roommate Hemanth), so I did not understand how powerfully people felt for sports. This speaks on her values on loyalty and love for something she strongly resides with. If someone attacks something she holds dear, she is not afraid to fight back and protect what she loves. Her intense devotion for the Patriots is a representation of her protective instincts and is a trait that many, including myself, seek to have one day - the strength and sheer amount of love and passion for something we value. I hope to spend more time with her watching Patriot games and residing next to her radiating enthusiatic energy, similar to this picture she has with her brother when the Patriots won the Super Bowl.
