subtitle: Who is she?
---

This website is dedicated to expressing how amazing Sonam is. She does not receive nearly as much recognition and praise for her vibrant and powerful character. Sonam is truly a one-of-a-kind partner and has outstanding qualities and accomplishments. My intention with this website is to express completely all the emotions I feel for this girl - I have severely lacked the vocal communication to show her value throughout our relationship. I want to make things right and I understand that words are not enough compared to action and although I cannot be there with her physically, I want to show her what she means to me. I will do my best to incorporate everything I feel into this website through blog posts about her character to this section here about her history.  

### Shrewsbury, Massachusetts
Sonam was born and raised in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. I do not know much about her life from back then because she moved to Arizona early in her life, but one thing I do know is that she is a die-hard passionate Patriots fan. One time, I undermined her committment to the team in which she was vividly upset with me. I have only encountered a similar minded sports fan before earlier that year (my roommate Hemanth), so I did not understand how powerfully people felt for sports. This speaks on her values on loyalty and love for something she strongly resides with. If someone attacks something she holds dear, she is not afraid to fight back and protect what she loves. Her intense devotion for the Patriots is a representation of her protective instincts and is a trait that many, including myself, seek to have one day - the strength and sheer amount of love and passion for something we value. I hope to spend more time with her watching Patriot games and residing next to her radiating enthusiatic energy, similar to this picture she has with her brother when the Patriots won the Super Bowl.

### Chandler, Arizona
Sonam moved to Chandler, Arizona, and spent her years there during middle school and high school, attending BASIS Chandler and Hamilton High respectively. Here, Sonam was a part of a variety of school activities, both academic as well as extra-curricular. To touch upon her athleticism, she was on the volleyball team and enjoys playing tennis. In addition to that, Sonam was part of her school's dance team, in which she took a leadership role in choreographing dances in front of thousands of students. She also engaged with her peers and teachers in her community by being a TA for her english class and succeeding in many AP classes, especially Spanish, where she was part of the Spanish Honor Society. Sonam was the the Editor-In-Chief for two years for the school's newsletter Paw Print, where she oversaw an entire team of publishers and authors as well as creating and editing articles of her own. She extended her love for writing by interning at a local magazine as a journalist and had her articles published.

Now this is a *brief* overview on what Sonam has done in school and I am being modest with my descriptions because it is already overwhelming on how involved she was in various activities. However, this is only the surface of what this magnificent girl has done. On top of all of these committments, Sonam pursued her love for singing, in which she flew out and auditioned for The Voice as well as sang at local restaurants. She recorded covers of her favorite songs (especially by Bruno Mars) on her instagram and posted them fearlessly and powerfully. I would be afraid of exposing myself to the public through videos, but her courage and bravery to relentlessly showcase her insane singing talent triumphs over any doubt and fear. Futhermore, Sonam tutored young children English from Title I schools in her community, where mostly low-income students attend. A lot of people focus all their time towards themselves and their development, but Sonam went out to help neglected children with their education and created writing curriculum - I admire not only the quality education that she provided but also the opportunity she showed these students that someone cared for them and made it her effort to see them succeed outside of class. She continues to help out her community through volunteering, whether it be in Arizona or at the beaches in San Diego.

### San Diego, California
I am limiting this section to focus on her life and activities in San Diego, but I will get into more depth about her influence in my life in later blog posts. Sonam came into college as an Economics major, but later switched into International Business after quickly realizing her distaste in that field. She joined the collegiate Bollywood Fusion dance team, where she spent hours till 1 A.M practicing and loving the sport with her new friends. She enjoyed spending time independently singing in the Courtroom and hanging out with her new friends, whether that be dance, roommates, or my friend group at Geisel, apartments, etc. One place she especially enjoyed eating at was Blue Pepper, a Thai cuisine located on campus, and BJs, where she would go with her friends for the pazookies. A large part of her time was spent hanging out with my friends and I goofing off or chilling at the apartment instead of studying. She kept herself busy with classes and activities and was the happiest she had ever been given her newfound freedom and independence.

Sonam did not do as well as she had hoped for in terms of grades in college and faced a lot of ambiguity of her future career. Instead of wallowing in her misery, she surpassed all expectations and managed to get straight A's in her final freshman quarter for four classes while facing a new virtual quarantined environment. I have never heard personally from anyone flipping their grades like that in one single quarter. Despite all doubt she face from prior experience, she worked hard in meeting with TAs, completing assignments on time, and attending lectures, which paid off tremendously in the end. I have the upmost respect of Sonam in turning her academic career around when she had every reason to be upset from the last two quarters and lose hope. This speaks on how Sonam is - she believes in herself wholeheartedly and knows what she is capable of, pushing her limits and exceeding expectations.

### Current Day
Due to the pandemic, Sonam is back home, where she is working at Panera as well as interning for an advertising company instead of sitting idlely at home. At times, she will livestream her singing on her instagram and create choreographs on Tik Toks, continuing to pursue those activities she thrives in.

### Final Note
She is literally amazing and I cannot be more impressed and in awe as I am writing this out. Sonam has done so much in this world and yet no one takes the time to acknowledge all the work she has done. She is still 18 years old and has done so much with her life already and yet so many people have kicked her down, unfortunately myself included. Her tech-savvy family is focused more on STEM accomplishments and people in her past have abandoned her because of her strong characteristics. Who was I to treat her with such lack of respect from the start? Even though I was aware of these accomplishments, I never accounted her struggles to achieve these goals and did not show any appreciation. Instead, I treated her like the rest and intentionally put her down through jokes and implicit meanings where she looked up to me for support and instead I put her down. That sucks.

Writing all this out made me truly realize how special of a girl Sonam is from what she has done, not only for herself but for others. Sonam unknowingly created so many avenues and opportunities for those around her and I do not think she is aware of how large of an impact she has had on other people. Despite hate from others, she kept her head up and followed through with all her activities - she led a team of dancers, standing as a strong role model, to perform in front of crowd and led a team of writers for the newsletter published to thousands of students. She was a beacon of light for girls younger than her and set her bravery as an example for others to follow and pursue what they love strongly. She has done so much for her community by instilling her strong characteristics and compassionately working with so many people of different ages. She does not reflect her own problems and struggles onto others, but uses them instead to elevate those around her because she understands what it mean to be there for someone. She was there for her dancers, her writers, her students, her dancers, her friends, and her family. She devoted that same attention and amplified it towards me in the relationship and I was deaf and ignorant to what I had, taking it for granted until losing it all.
