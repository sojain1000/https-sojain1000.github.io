subtitle: Who is she?
---

This website is dedicated to expressing how amazing Sonam is. She does not receive nearly as much recognition and praise for her vibrant and powerful character. Sonam is truly a one-of-a-kind partner and has outstanding qualities and accomplishments. My intention with this website is to express completely all the emotions I feel for this girl - I have severely lacked the vocal communication to show her value throughout our relationship. I want to make things right and I understand that words are not enough compared to action and although I cannot be there with her physically, I want to show her what she means to me. I will do my best to incorporate everything I feel into this website through blog posts about her character to this section here about her history.  

### Early Life
Sonam was born and raised in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. I do not know much about her life from back then because she moved to Arizona early in her life, but one thing I do know is that she is a die-hard passionate Patriots fan. One time, I undermined her committment to the team in which she was vividly upset with me. I have only encountered a similar minded sports fan before earlier that year (my roommate Hemanth), so I did not understand how powerfully people felt for sports. This speaks on her values on loyalty and love for something she strongly resides with. If someone attacks something she holds dear, she is not afraid to fight back and protect what she loves. Her intense devotion for the Patriots is a representation of her protective instincts and is a trait that many, including myself, seek to have one day - the strength and sheer amount of love and passion for something we value. I hope to spend more time with her watching Patriot games and residing next to her radiating enthusiatic energy, similar to this picture she has with her brother when the Patriots won the Super Bowl.

### Chandler, Arizona
Sonam moved to Chandler, Arizona, and spent her years there during middle school and high school, attending BASIS Chandler and Hamilton High respectively. Here, Sonam was a part of a variety of school activities, both academic as well as extra-curricular. To touch upon her athleticism, she was on the volleyball team and enjoys playing tennis. In addition to that, Sonam was part of her school's dance team, in which she took a leadership role in choreographing dances in front of thousands of students. She also engaged with her peers and teachers in her community by being a TA for her english class and succeeding in many AP classes, especially Spanish, where she was part of the Spanish Honor Society. Sonam was the the Editor-In-Chief for two years for the school's newsletter Paw Print, where she oversaw an entire team of publishers and authors as well as creating and editing articles of her own. She extended her love for writing by interning at a local magazine as a journalist and had her articles published.

Now this is a *brief* overview on what Sonam has done in school and I am being modest with my descriptions because it is already overwhelming on how involved she was in various activities. However, this is only the surface of what this magnificent girl has done. On top of all of these committments, Sonam pursued her love for singing, in which she flew out and auditioned for The Voice as well as sang at local restaurants. She recorded covers of her favorite songs (especially by Bruno Mars) on her instagram and posted them fearlessly and powerfully. I would be afraid of exposing myself to the public through videos, but her courage and bravery to relentlessly showcase her insane singing talent triumphs over any doubt and fear. Futhermore, Sonam tutored young children English from Title I schools in her community, where mostly low-income students attend. A lot of people focus all their time towards themselves and their development, but Sonam went out to help impoverished children with their education and created writing curriculum - I admire not only the quality education that she provided but also the opportunity she showed these students that someone cared for them and made it her effort to see them succeed outside of class. She continues to help out her community through volunteering, whether it be in Arizona or her college at UC San Diego.

She is literally amazing and I cannot be more impressed and in awe as I am writing this out. Sonam has done so much in this world and yet no one takes the time to acknowledge all the work she has done. She is still 18 years old and has done so much with her life already and yet so many people have kicked her down, unfortunately myself included. Her tech-savvy family is focused more on STEM accomplishments and people in her past have abandoned her because of her strong characteristics.
