Hey there S. I don't know if you will ever read this because I am not sure if you will come across this website anytime soon. But I wanted to revive this as a way to
put down my thoughts and feelings on where we are at. 

I have felt like I am going through a paper shredder at every moment without having you by my side. I have given our situation so much thought, even going as far as 
talking to myself about everything. It's tough to understand it all completely because I always lose sight on your perspective and get caught up in my world.

Although I cannot understand completely what you are feeling, I can relate in some way to feeling out of it in this relationship and losing that spark with your
significant other. This reason and content of this website should be enough evidence to support that. I was at a point where I did not really care much about being
in this relationship, feeling like I am in it for the sake of being in it. That wasn't the right mentality and it got us to a point where we could not move forward
without reform. I hope I can shed some light on what flipped the switch back for me and realized that this was something that I truly wanted. As hard as it is for me
to wrap my head around, this is something that is out of my hands at the end of the day no matter how badly I want us to work, no matter how much I want to do for us.

I had to reevaluate what you meant to me, not as a girlfriend but as Sonam so I took a step back to look at your role in my life overall. I realized that I did not 
appreciate what I had in front of me and did not comprehend a reality without you. I had undermined your influence until I soon understood that I could not see 
myself being the same person without you. You have become a part of me and all that I have gone through has been with you by my side. I am so grateful to have had you
always instead of being alone because I know how that feels. In Spring quarter during freshman year, I had no one and closed everyone off as self-punishment. I was at
such a low point in life in every aspect and you were there to pick up to a place higher than I have ever been. You don't realize it but you literally turned my life
around, my college experience from a negative to a positive. Something that I can be completely proud of as a by-product for going to UCSD. I reminded myself on what
you meant to me and never forgot what you did for me. That is why I have an endless amount of love for you because you gave me everything and more, making me the 
happiest that I have been in a while. It took me losing you for some time for it to slap me across the face and see what I am losing out on. You are absolutely
amazing in everything that you do and I know that you are someone I want to keep for a long time. 

The pain I felt after losing that passion for our relationship and us deciding to take some space during the summer was a stark reminder of how raw my emotions are
for you. I did not feel good walking away because I knew that a mistake had been made. I knew that I had a lot to work on but I was so strongly motivated to push
forward in an effort of keeping what we had. You can attest to the change because I worked so hard to adapt to our relationship and needs. Remember our struggles
that we have gone through together and realize how strong that made our relationship. It feels like every day feels the same in this pandemic, but take some time
to really look back at everything and remind yourself on why we fought so hard. What we saw in our future and believed in so strongly.

I don't think it is constructive to tell you how much I love you and everything that I have done and will do for you. That isn't the issue at hand right now. I pray
everyday that we can make it work together and come out of this stronger than we ever have. I know these last few months have been some of the roughest moments we 
have both gone through, either individually or as a relationship. We have had some ugly conversations, late night frustrations and arguments, and intense emotions.
I understand that this coupled with everything else you deal with has taken a huge toll on your mental state. But, I hope you look into a reality where I am not there
anymore as your boyfriend similarly to how I looked at it before with you in which you truly evaluate if you think you would be better off alone. Not having your #1
anymore to go to and talk about whatever whenever. Not receiving that unconditional love and support through everything at any time anymore. Not being able to say 
"I love you" to me anymore. Not being able to hug and kiss me whenever. 

Long distance is ridicuously tough and I don't think it is a viable option if thrown into it unexpectedly like we have. Our relationship thus far has been defined
through long distance, defined through Facetime and iMessage and Netflix/Hulu. It is completely reasonable for you to feel burned out of this relationship and not
feeling much motivation to push forward. What was worked for me is that I have not lost sight on our goal of coming back together normally in person and how 
awesome it is going to be just like how it was back in college. Instead of defining our relationship so narrowly, it will be compromised of actual in-person love,
ranging from everything physical to eating at new places to meeting new people to driving to scenic places and more. There is so much more we can do and I do not
want to do our past selves injustice for waiting it out this long because I know how much we looked forward to this. It has literally been over 365 days now. That
is why I called back a second time to give this a shot because I realized that this could all be a product of long distance and that our dynamic will be much more
different than it is now. Although it is a reasonable hypothesis, this is me also out of desperation to make this work and pull you back into your old self. I 
made assumptions that you will be the same when we are in SD, not feeling the same way as you did when we were back in college before and thinking of me less. But
that is unfair for me to predict and rule this out already, so I pray that it will be different and I know I will do everything in my power to bring you back.

I have gotten to a point where I am scared for us. Out of fear and desperation, I am trying to piece this all together and be strong but to be frank, this has been
gnawing at me for quite some time to where I spoke up about it. I never have made myself a priority nor do I speak up about any issues. It was the hardest moment for
me to call you and tell you that I was unhappy with how I felt like I was being treated, as if I am an afterthought, less of a priroity, imbalanced in our relationship.
I want this to work and I know that I am the best for you. I am working on improving myself everyday and I know you are as well. Just please dig deep inside and remember
that spark for me. What I mean to you and how much you care for me, how much love you have for me. I never doubted your emotions or character because you do love me 
so strongly and you have been a terrific girlfriend for me in more ways that you think. Please tap into that love and see my value in being your boyfriend in your life.
We are such an amazing fit together and we both have strong ambitions and goals in which we elevate each other. You pick me up when I am down and I pick you up 
when you are down. Please don't forget what we mean to each other. I'm coming back to see you soon for 3 months and we have so much planned together. Let's enjoy
our time to the fullest together in person and make up for all the time we lost. Please see what we are together and realize that we are stronger than ourselves
individually, that you do not need to isolate and close yourself off and that I can be there. I was well aware of what I was getting in with you after the night
at the canyon and I promised myself that I will share the most love that you have ever gotten from someone. I am not someone from your past in Arizona, I am special
and determined to make your life the best that it can be. Believe me on that, we will work on this together and then I know you will be back to love again.

I love you Sonam and you are truly special. I would not put up so much of a fight if I did not see something in us. We can do this, just believe in what we are. 
Remind yourself of what Ayush and Sonam are. Look back at everything we have gone through. Take in the raw strong emotions of our love and care and reflect on why
that is the case. Think about what you saw/see in me and why we did this in the first place. Study me and see what is it about me that you love. Come back to sight
on what our relationship is and always will be. Don't be phased out on recent events, we do not let that us define who we are and how we feel. We are strong.

Take care of yourself, I always have you in my thoughts everyday and hope that this break helps you in seeing what you want.

Love,
A
